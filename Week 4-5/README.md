# Final Project

## Overview
This project involves the creation of a Snake Game and an AI Agent capable of playing the game using Deep Q-Learning. The project is divided into two main parts:

1. **Manually Controlled Snake Game**: Implement the classic Snake Game controlled by user input.
2. **AI Agent with Deep Q-Learning**: Design an AI Agent and train it using the Deep Q-Learning algorithm to play the Snake Game autonomously.

## Getting Started
You can follow the tutorial playlist linked below as a guide for implementing the project:

### Recommendations:
- Watch the first two lectures to:
  - Learn how to create the basic Snake Game.
  - Understand the structure of an AI model.
- After completing the basics, try implementing the AI Agent and training it on your own.

## Steps to Complete the Project

1. **Snake Game**:
   - Create a grid-based environment for the game.
   - Implement game mechanics such as snake movement, food placement, and score tracking.
   - Add keyboard controls for manual gameplay.

2. **AI Agent**:
   - Design a Feed Forward neural network model for the AI Agent.
   - Implement the Deep Q-Learning algorithm for training.
   - Train the AI Agent to play the game by maximizing rewards.
