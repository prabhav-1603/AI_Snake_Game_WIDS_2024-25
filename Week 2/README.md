For this week, we will focus on the basics of Machine Learning specifically Neural Networks:

1) Linear Regression
(We won't be using this algorithm directly, but learning it will help you understand how to code algorithms and give you an idea of a typical machine learning algorithm.)

Try to implement it yourself as well.

2) Introduction to Neural Networks
(This video provides a basic understanding and use of neural networks so that you don't feel bored in the next tutorial. ðŸ˜„)

For this playlist only the first 4 videos are necessary; the rest are optional and not required for this project.


Assignment:
Set up a basic feed forward neural network that can take images from the MNIST dataset and identify them accurately. You can use the Pytorch library to do this. You can submit .py as well as .ipynb files for this task.
Note: We know that the tutorials we provided mostly cover the implementation of the neural network, we just want you to play with it yourself and understand each part of the code.
