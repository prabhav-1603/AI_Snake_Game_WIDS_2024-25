# Week 2: Basics of Machine Learning and Neural Networks

## Topics Covered

1. **Linear Regression**  
   - *We won't be using this algorithm directly, but learning it will help you understand how to code algorithms and provide an idea of a typical machine learning algorithm.*

## Assignment  

1. **Objective**:  
   Set up a basic feed-forward neural network that can take images from the MNIST handwritten digits dataset and identify them accurately.  

2. **Tools**:  
   Use the PyTorch library to complete this task.  

3. **Submission**:  
   Submit your implementation as a `.py` or `.ipynb` file.  

4. **Note**:  
   The tutorials provided primarily cover the implementation of a neural network. However, we encourage you to experiment with the code and develop a solid understanding of each part.
